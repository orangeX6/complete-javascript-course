// Why worry about architecture?
// Structure
// Maintainability
// Expandability

// We ll use MVC
// We can use framework like React, Angular, Vue, Svelte

//-> Components of any architecture
//>>    Business Logic
//>>    State
//>>    HTTP Library
//>>    Application Logic (ROUTER)
//>>    Presentation Logic (UI LAYER)

//-> Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture
//>> MODEL
//* Business Logic
//* State
//* HTTP Library

//>> CONTROLLER
//* Application Logic
// Bridge between model and views
// Handles UI events and dispatches tasks to model and view

//>> VIEW
//* Presentation logic
