var i = 0; i++        // <-- semicolon obligatory
                      //     (but optional before newline)
var i = 0             // <-- semicolon optional
    i++               // <-- semicolon optional
    
    
Variables - var,let,const
var - function scope
let - block scope

Type conversion and type coercion
conversion is when we manually convert from one type to another
coercion is when java script automatically convert types behind the scenes for us.


Mathematical Operators - +, -, *, %, /
Assignment operators -  =, +=, -=,*=, ++,--
Comparison operators - > , < , <=, >= ,  
Equality Operators -  ===, !, !==
Logical Boolean Operatorss - AND, OR, NOT

=== -> Strict eequality. does not allow coercion;
== -> Allows coercion


Conditionals ->  if,if..else, ternary

Since ternary operator is an expression we can use it template literal, unlike if else

JS has 5 falsy values - 0, '', undefined, null, NaN






Functions 
Difference between argument and parameter - parameter is the placeholder in the function where as the argument is the actual value that is passed to the function.
Function Declaration can be called before they are defined in the code. We can call it first and then define.
In function expression we cannot call it first and then define.

Arrow functions are great for a quick one line code. They dont have "this" keyword.

Events (Listen for activity in the browser)

For avoiding errors when script in head 
Internal JS - <script> 
			document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {})
		   </script>
External JS - Async and defer. Ezample - <script src="script.js" defer></script>









Biggest Difference between var and let - 
var - Supports Hoisting (Declaring a variable after use)
let 
const 

Strict mode - The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.You can use strict mode in all your programs. It helps you to write cleaner code, like preventing you from using undeclared variables.
As an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable.

typeof - returns type of variable. Eg - number, String, etc.










Strings - 

length
indexOf
slice
toLowerCase
toUpperCase
replace

stringName.length
stringName.indexOf('stringPart')
stringName.slice(0,3)
stringName.toLowerCase();
stringName.toUpperCase();
stringName.replace('moz','van');











Arrays

let shopping = ['bread', 'milk', 'cheese', 'hummus', 'noodles'];
let sequence = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13];
let random = ['tree', 795, [0, 1, 2]];


split
toString
join

push and unshift - add to array
pop and shift - remove from array

friends.push('Rosh'); //adds element to the end of the array
friends.unshift('Akash') // add element to the beginning of the array
friends.shift(); //removes the first element
friends.pop() // removes the last element

//In dot notation we have to use the real property name and can not use the expression.
// we can also store an expression in bracket notation which can hold the key 
//For eg 
const nameKey = 'Name'
console.log(Pranav['first' + nameKey]);
console.log(Pranav['last' + nameKey]);

//When we need to compute the property name we have to use the bracket notation.In other cases we use the dot notation mostly











DOM - Document Object Model - Is a structural representation of HTML documents. Allows Javascript to access 
HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.
Document - special element that is the entry point to DOM. Example - document.querySelector()
DOM is not actually the part of javascript. It is a part of Web APIs that browser use from where we can access our JS code.











//WE DONT HAVE TO WRITE BRACKETS FOR ONE LINE OF LOOP
EG - for (let i = 0; i < btnOpenModal.length; i++)
        console.log(btnOpenModal[i].textContent);

addEventListener()
removeEventListener()

//KEYBOARD EVENTS ARE GLOBAL EVENTS, BECAUSE DO NOT HAPPEN ON ONE
// SPECIFIC ELEMENT, AND FOR GLOBAL EVENTS LIKE KEYBOARD EVENTS, WE LISTEN ON
// WHOLE DOCUMENTS
Keyboard events - 1. keydown 2.keypress 3. keyup

GET ELEMENT BY ID - 

const score0 = document.querySelector('#score--0');
const score1 = document.querySelector('#score--1');

//THE ABOVE CAN ALSO BE WRITTEN AS
const score0 = document.getElementById('score--0');
const score1 = document.getElementById('score--1');
//getElementById is faster than querySelector. We dont need to 
use the # symbol in getElementById













//HOW JAVASCRIPT WORKS _ 
JS is a high level, object oriented, multi paradigm programming language



High Level 

What is a Javascript engine? 
A computer program that simply executed js code.
Every browser has its own JS engine. 
Chrome uses the V8 engine. It also powers nodeJS.
Every JS engine contains 
1 . Callstack 
2. Heap

1. Callstack - 
where our code is executed 
2. Heap - 
Unstructured memory pool where objects are stored.


Compilation vs Interpretation
Compilation - entire code is converted into machine code at once, and written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer, way later than its compilation.

	Source code --Compilation-- > Portable File: Machine code-- Execution--> Program running. 

Interpretation - Interpreter runs through the source code line by line. code is written and executed all at the same time.
 Source code ------Execution line by line----> Program running.
 
Previously JS used to be a fully interpreted language, but interpreted languages are slow.

Now JS uses a combination of both compilation and interpretation, i.e., Just in time compilation (JIT).

Entire code is converted into machine code at once, then executed immediately. 
Source code --Compilation-- >  Machine code-- Execution--> Program running.
This is lot faster than executing code line by line

JIT compilation 
 			Parsing 
 		(Abstract Syntax Tree)
				|
				V
			Compilation
				|	
				V
			Execution
		(Happens in call stack)
		
APIs are functionality provided to the engine but are not actually a part of Javascript itself.
Javascript simply gets access to these APIs through the global window object.
But it still makes sense that the APIs are still part of the runtime, because a runtime is just like a box that contains all the javascript related stuff that we need.
A typical javascript runtime also includes a so called javascript callback queue.
Its a data structure that contain all the callback functions that are ready to be executed. 
For eg - click, timer, data ... 
APIs eg - web apis, (c++ threads,binding in nodeJS)
 


Garbage Collected

Interpreted or just-in-time compiled

Multi-Paradigm - 
	1. Procedural programming
	2. Object oriented programming
	3. Functional Programming


Prototype-based Object-oriented
	1. Almost everything in js is an object. 


First Class Functions
In a language with first class functions, functions are simply treated as variables. We can pass them into other functions, and return them from functions.

Dynamic
Dynamically-typed Language: 
No data type definitions. Types becomes known at runtime. Data type of variable is automatically changed.

If you want to use javascript as a strongly type languagge then you should learn about Typescript

Single Threaded


Non-blocking event loop concurrency model - 
Concurrency model : How the javascript engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.

Why we need it ? - coz js runs in one single thread, so it can only do one thing at a time.

So what about long running task?
Sounds like it would block the single thread. However, we want non blocking behavior!

How do we achieve that ? 
By using an event loop : takes long running tasks, executed them in the background, and puts them in the main thread once they are finished.





















Abort Signal
const controller = new AbortController()
controller.abort();

 e.stopPropagation();
 
 
encapsulation 
stored inside an object package
  
abstraction 

instantiation

polymorphism

inheritance


Constructors and Object instances 
Constructor function name usually starts with a capital letter.

Function constructor
function Person(name) {
	this.name = name;
	this.greeting = function() {alert('Hi I am ' + this.name)}
}

Object Constructor
let person1 = new Object();

let person1 = new Object({
  name: 'Chris',
  age: 38,
  greeting: function() {
    alert('Hi! I\'m ' + this.name + '.');
  }
});




Using create method 
create()

let person2 = Object.create(person1);



Prototypes - mechanism by which js objects inherit features from one another 
An object's prototype object may also have a prototype object, 
which it inherits methods and properties from, and so on. This is often referred to as a prototype chain, 
and explains why different objects have properties and methods defined on other objects available to them.
__proto__ 


JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
Converting a string to a native object is called deserialization, 
while converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted 
across the network is called serialization.

XMLHttpRequest - XHR - API to call JSON 
we use an API called XMLHttpRequest (often called XHR). This is a very useful JavaScript object 
that allows us to make network requests to retrieve resources from a server via JavaScript
 (e.g. images, text, JSON, even HTML snippets), 
meaning that we can update small sections of content without having to reload the entire page



A thread is basically a single process that a program can use to complete tasks.


Each task will be run sequentially; a task has to complete before the next one can be started.

As we said earlier, many computers now have multiple cores, so can do multiple things at once. 
Programming languages that can support multiple threads can use multiple
cores to complete multiple tasks simultaneously
